# Opioid-prescribing-Rate-in-USA

#Description:
This project applies linear regression analysis to a detailed dataset encompassing opioid claims and socioeconomic factors. The primary datasets include opioid claims with variables like FIPS codes, state-specific data, and total opioid prescriptions. We also integrated socioeconomic factors such as unemployment rates and median household income.

#Key Components:

Dataset: Opioid claims merged with socioeconomic data, totaling over 18,000 rows post-cleaning.
Variables: Key metrics include opioid prescribing rates, changes in rates, household income, and unemployment rates.
Model: Linear regression used to identify trends and predictors in opioid abuse.
Performance Metrics: Employed Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared for model accuracy.
Visualization: Created insightful plots like scatter plots with regression lines, residuals plots, and state-wise comparisons to interpret the model's performance.
This repository provides a comprehensive view of opioid abuse patterns, aiding in targeted resource allocation for public health initiatives.
