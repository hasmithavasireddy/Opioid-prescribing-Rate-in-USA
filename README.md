**Project: Healthcare Analytics for Opioid Abuse Resource Allocation**

**Description:**
This project applies linear regression analysis to a detailed dataset encompassing opioid claims and socioeconomic factors. The primary datasets include opioid claims with variables like FIPS codes, state-specific data, and total opioid prescriptions. We also integrated socioeconomic factors such as unemployment rates and median household income.

**Key Components:**

**Dataset:** Opioid claims merged with socioeconomic data, totaling over 18,000 rows post-cleaning.
**Variables:** Key metrics include opioid prescribing rates, changes in rates, household income, and unemployment rates.
**Model:** Linear regression used to identify trends and predictors in opioid abuse.
**Performance Metrics:** Employed Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared for model accuracy.
**Visualization:** Created insightful plots like scatter plots with regression lines, residual plots, and state-wise comparisons to interpret the model's performance.

This repository provides a comprehensive view of opioid abuse patterns, aiding in targeted resource allocation for public health initiatives.
